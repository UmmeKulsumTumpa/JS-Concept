##  THE MAIN CONCEPT — GENERICALLY

###  **Function Scope** (Concept)

> A **function scope** means that a new scope (or "variable container") is created **every time a function is defined/executed**.

**Only functions** create function scope.

So:
```js
function something() {
  // <- function scope starts here
  // variables declared here live inside this function
}
```

Anything declared inside this function is **not accessible from outside**, and this scope is **not shared with other functions**.

---

###  **Block Scope** (Concept)

> A **block scope** means that a new scope is created **whenever you use a `{}` block**, **even if it’s not a function**.

This includes:
```js
if (true) {
  // block scope
}

for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  // block scope
}

{
  // also a block scope
}
```

But here's the key:
- **block scope is smaller than function scope**.
- Block scope can **exist inside a function** (nested).
- But **not all blocks are functions**.

---

##  HERE’S THE BIG IDEA:

- A **function** always creates a **function scope**, and it also acts like a block (so it *can* have block-scoped variables inside it).
- A **block** (like `{}`) is **not a function**, and only affects variables that are block scoped (like `let`, `const`, or in newer languages, sometimes pattern matching or destructuring stuff).

---

##  Pure Example Without Using var/let/const

Just for visualization:

```js
function outer() {
  // Function Scope starts
  {
    // Block Scope starts
  }
  // Block Scope ends
}
// Function Scope ends
```

There is:
- **One function scope** (for `outer`)
- **One block scope** (inside the `{}`)

They are **different scopes**!

---

##  Real Code to Show the Difference

```js
function test() {
  let a = 1; // in function scope

  {
    let b = 2; // in block scope
    console.log(a); // ✅ can access function scoped var
  }

  console.log(b); // ❌ ReferenceError: b is not defined
}
```

Explanation:
- `a` is in the **function scope**, so visible *anywhere in `test()`*.
- `b` is in the **block scope**, so only visible inside `{}`.

---

##  Conclusion (One-Liner Style)

- **Function scope**: variables are tied to the function in which they are declared.
- **Block scope**: variables are tied to the `{}` block in which they are declared.
- All functions are blocks, but not all blocks are functions.
- Blocks can be nested inside functions to create smaller scopes.
