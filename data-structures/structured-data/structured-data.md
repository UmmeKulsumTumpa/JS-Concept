##  What Is Structured Data?

**Structured Data** is any data that is organized in a predictable format — typically as key-value pairs (like in an object or a table). 

In **JavaScript**, structured data often refers to objects and arrays:
```js
// Simple structured data
const person = {
  name: "Alice",
  age: 25,
  skills: ["JavaScript", "Python"]
};
```

But in **web development**, *Structured Data Markup* is specifically data you add to your HTML to help search engines like Google understand what your content means.

##  Why Use Structured Data on Websites?

When you add structured data to your web pages, it helps Google **understand your content better**, and display **rich results** in search. Like:

- Star ratings
- Recipe details
- Product availability
- FAQ dropdowns

It makes your listings stand out and can increase **click-through rates** significantly.

##  Structured Data Formats

Google supports three main formats:

| Format     | Description                                                                 | Recommended? |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------|
| **JSON-LD** | JavaScript-based, placed inside `<script>` tag. Most flexible.              | ✅ Yes |
| **Microdata** | Inline HTML attributes. Harder to maintain.                                 | ❌ Less ideal |
| **RDFa**     | Also inline HTML attributes, mostly used in semantic web contexts.         | ❌ Less ideal |

### ✅ JSON-LD Example (Recommended)
```html
<script type="application/ld+json">
{
  "@context": "https://schema.org",
  "@type": "Recipe",
  "name": "Spaghetti Bolognese",
  "author": {
    "@type": "Person",
    "name": "John Doe"
  },
  "cookTime": "PT30M",
  "recipeIngredient": ["Pasta", "Meat", "Tomato Sauce"]
}
</script>
```

This doesn’t display to users, but search engines read it and can use it to create rich results.

##  How It Works in Google Search

Google uses this structured data to **enhance** the way your page appears in search results.

Example:
- Without structured data: just a plain link and description.
- With structured data: includes ratings, price, cooking time, etc.

##  Real Results

Some big sites got measurable improvements:
- **Rotten Tomatoes**: +25% CTR
- **The Food Network**: +35% visits
- **Nestlé**: +82% CTR on rich result pages

##  How to Test Structured Data

Use Google's free tools:
- [Rich Results Test](https://search.google.com/test/rich-results)
- [Search Console](https://search.google.com/search-console/about)

---

##  Schema Vocabulary

Most structured data follows the vocabulary from [**schema.org**](https://schema.org). It includes types like:

- `Person`
- `Product`
- `Event`
- `Recipe`
- `FAQPage`

You don’t have to memorize them all. Google’s [Search Central docs](https://developers.google.com/search/docs/appearance/structured-data/intro-structured-data) will guide you for each type.
